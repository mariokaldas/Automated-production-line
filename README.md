Cartesian robotic arm code that responsible for assembly and storing stages

- This is not a code for the whole project it's only for the robotic arm part which is responsible for two stages from the project

- Drivers used:
- Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) :
  1- Infrared sensor (IR)
  2- LCD
  3- Limit switch
  4- Servo motor
  5- Stepper motor driver that supports : TB6600 - A4988

- Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL) :
  1- GPIO
  2- Timers
